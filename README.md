## 📌 About the Project

After completing an unforgettable outdoor adventure, important details such as trail conditions, routes, weather, or hidden landmarks are often forgotten or scattered across different apps and devices. OutdoorXplorer addresses this problem by providing a dedicated digital journal that consolidates all adventure-related information in one place.

The platform helps users not only revisit past journeys but also plan future adventures more effectively using historical data and insights.
